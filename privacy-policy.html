        <h1>Service Providers</h1>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

            <p>Here are the links to the policies of third party service providers used by the app</p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy" style="">Google Privacy Policy</a>-->

        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your information. But remember that no method of
            transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot
            guarantee its absolute security. </p>

        <h1>Links to Other Sites</h1>
        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
            that site. Note that these external sites are seperate from Widgetshare. Therefore, we strongly advise you
            to
            review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the
            content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. </p>


        <h1>Photos</h1>
        <p>We work hard to keep your image data private and secure.</p>
        <p>When you send an image in Widgetshare it gets stored in
            our database so that the users you sent it to can access it. Once
            you send a new image to a widget or user, the old image you sent will be permanently deleted from the
            database.
        </p>
        <p>Once an image is deleted from the database it is no longer accessible to users who have not seen it before.
            For users who have seen the image, it may still be saved on their personal devices.
        </p>
        <p>The app has an image history feature that saves a history of your sent and recieved images. This information
            is only stored on your device. Thus it is not accesible from anywhere else. Note that deleting the app or
            clearing the app data will permanently delete this image history. </p>


            <h2>Downloading or Deleting Your Data</h2>
            <p>To download or delete your data, you can send an email to info@widgetshare.com with the request. The app also features a delete account button. You can use this button to permanently delete all of your account data.</p>
        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
            for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These
            changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
